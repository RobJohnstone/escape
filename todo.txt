BUGS:

None (alright, there are bound to be some, but I haven't found them yet!)

TASKS:

Add additional tile graphics and update tileset object
Commit

tileset editor

Write entity bitmap graphics code (separate into separate tasks)

Improve modularisation of code (modules are way to long)

Tests!

Re-engineer non-game code (e.g. screen, campaign, game.js, edit.js). This code is more or less universally terrible.

Baddies should check if they have a clear line of shot

Allow health to regenerate over time

Intelligent save - based on when you last killed a baddie (with a suitable delay)

Improve path finding so that if there are no obstacles, move directly rather than going from tile centre to tile centre as used with A*

Add steering behaviour to path finding code

Tidy up routing in server.js (there's huge repetition between camapigns and maps)
