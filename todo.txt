BUGS:

None (alright, there are bound to be some, but I haven't found them yet!)

TASKS:

Improve modularisation of code (modules are way to long)

Add support for walking rather than travelling at max velocity

Tests!

Re-engineer non-game code (e.g. screen, campaign and palette modules). This code is more or less universally terrible. Some kind of UI library would be best.

Create a prototype campaign

Write bitmap graphics code (separate into separate tasks)

Improve path finding so that if there are no obstacles, move directly rather than going from tile centre to tile centre as used with A*

Add steering behaviour to path finding code

Tidy up routing in server.js (there's huge repetition between camapigns and maps)

Consider using backbone (or homegrown alternative for editor)

Find (or write) documentation tool that better supports prototypal rather than classical inheritance
