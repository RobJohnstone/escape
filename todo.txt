BUGS:

Selecting an item removes the highlight from the select command
Event handlers still firing even when the map editor has exited to the other screens
There is too much anti-aliasing on the lines drawn with graphics.lineNow - is a half picel offset required?

TASKS:

Check use Strict

Improve modularisation of code (modules are way to long)

Add support for walking rather than travelling at max velocity

Tests!

Create a prototype campaign

Write bitmap graphics code (separate into separate tasks)

Improve path finding so that if there are no obstacles, move directly rather than going from tile centre to tile centre as used with A*

Tidy up routing in server.js (there's huge repetition between camapigns and maps)

Consider using backbone (or homegrown alternative for editor)

Write documentation tool that better supports prototypal rather than classical inheritance
