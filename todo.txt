BUGS:

Selecting an item removes the highlight from the select command
Event handlers still firing even when the map editor has exited to the other screens
There is too much anti-aliasing on the lines drawn with graphics.lineNow - is a half picel offset required?

TASKS:

Check use Strict

Add patrol tool to editor (done but shit. Must be able to overwrite existing info rather than merely adding new waypoints)

Improve modularisation of code (modules are way to long)

Add support for walking rather than travelling at max velocity

Create a prototype campaign

Tests!

Write bitmap graphics code (separate into separate tasks)

Improve path finding so that if there are no obstacles, move directly rather than going from tile centre to tile centre as used with A*

Tidy up routing in server.js (there's huge repetition between camapigns and maps)

Consider using backbone (or homegrown alternative for editor)

Write documentation tool that better supports prototypal rather than classical inheritance
