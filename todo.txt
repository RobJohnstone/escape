BUGS:

Taking focus away from the tab running the game rightly prompts the browser to reduce the frame rate. Very low frame rates cause bugs with collision detection (and probably other things) meaning that the game is rarely in a sensible state when you return to the tab

TASKS:

Check use Strict

Improve modularisation of code (modules are way to long)

Add support for walking rather than travelling at max velocity

Tests!

Re-engineer non-game code (e.g. screen, campaign and palette modules). This code is more or less universally terrible. Some kind of UI library would be best.

Create a prototype campaign

Write bitmap graphics code (separate into separate tasks)

Improve path finding so that if there are no obstacles, move directly rather than going from tile centre to tile centre as used with A*

Add steering behaviour to path finding code

Tidy up routing in server.js (there's huge repetition between camapigns and maps)

Consider using backbone (or homegrown alternative for editor)

Find (or write) documentation tool that better supports prototypal rather than classical inheritance
