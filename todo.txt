BUGS:

None (alright, there are bound to be some, but I haven't found them yet!)

TASKS:

Need an asynchronous asset loading pipeline that copes with assets (e.g. json directing that other assets should be loaded) Best approach would be to ensure that the check for loaded count occurs after assets have been loaded

Write bitmap graphics code (separate into separate tasks)

Improve modularisation of code (modules are way to long)

Tests!

Re-engineer non-game code (e.g. screen, campaign and palette modules). This code is more or less universally terrible. Some kind of UI library would be best.

Baddies should check if they have a clear line of shot

Allow health to regenerate over time

Intelligent save - based on when you last killed a baddie (with a suitable delay)

Improve path finding so that if there are no obstacles, move directly rather than going from tile centre to tile centre as used with A*

Add steering behaviour to path finding code

Tidy up routing in server.js (there's huge repetition between camapigns and maps)

Consider using backbone (or homegrown alternative for editor)

Find (or write) documentation tool that better supports prototypal rather than classical inheritance
