Escape
======

HTML5 Game - 1942: You are a British paratrooper captured in France during a raid on a secret German radar installation. Taken to a Gestapo interrogation centre you must now escape and return to Britain. 

This is an extremely early alpha (in fact it is more a prototype designed to test gameplay principles - hence the horrible vector graphics). If the gameplay is promising then this will eventually turn into a complete game

How to play:
------------

To be honest it's not really playable at the moment. If you really want to check it out then clone the repo and use your browser (Chrome only at the moment, but will be cross-browser in due course) to view the index.html file. But seriously, this is not yet a game. What might be more interesting is to look at the source and to compare with your own approaches in creating HTML5 games.

Technology:
-----------

+ canvas element
+ (*)localStorage
+ AJAX
+ (*)HTML5 audio
+ Javascript game engine
+ (*)An as yet undetermined server side setup for storing saved games, etc. Probably PHP or Python. Google App Engine is a strong contender at this point but it has not been properly looked into.

(*) indicates that the technology is not yet implemented

Dependencies:
-------------

JQuery (this is currently used for convenience but is used in only a few areas and may not be required in future)
